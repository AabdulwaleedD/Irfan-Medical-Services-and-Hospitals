# IRFAN Medical Services & Hospitals Dashboard Analysis

This repository contains screenshots and key insights from the **IRFAN Medical Services and Hospitals** clinical operations, performance, and financial dashboard. The data highlights real-world healthcare challenges in Nigeria, with a strong focus on hypertension burden, patient demographics, revenue cycle issues, and quality metrics.

## Overview
IRFAN Hospitals serves a predominantly southern Nigerian patient base (heavy concentration in Lagos, Rivers, Enugu, etc.), with high volumes of encounters driven by cardiovascular risks like hypertension (41% Stage 2), diabetes (18.7%), and smoking (13.9%). The dashboard reveals operational and financial opportunities in a context of heavy self-pay reliance and seasonal patterns.

## Key Findings
### 1. Patient Demographics & BMI
- ~2,000 patients recorded, average 7.3 encounters/day.
- Strong geographic skew: Lagos (317 patients), Rivers (287), Enugu (255+), Edo, Kano, etc. — mostly southern/south-eastern Nigeria.
- BMI distribution: Overweight largest group (38.5%), Normal + Overweight + Obese (Class I-III) dominate; underweight only ~6%.
- Adults (especially working-age) form the core patient group; pediatrics and older adults smaller.

### 2. Clinical Encounters & Hypertension Burden
- 8,000 encounters, ~12,775 diagnoses (~1.6 diagnoses/encounter).
- Hypertension prevalence: 27.5% overall; Stage 2 (41%), Stage 1 (25.6%), elevated (7.3%) — only ~7-8% normal BP.
- Vital signs average: Systolic BP 124.5 mmHg, Diastolic 77.4 mmHg, Heart Rate 77.4 bpm, BMI 25.9.
- Top risk factors: Diabetes (18.7%), Smoking (13.9%).
- Monthly peaks in August & October; mild seasonal variation.

### 3. Financial & Revenue Cycle Performance
- Total claims: ₦29.66M; Payments allowed: ₦20.77M; Actual payments: ₦16.67M (significant gap/leakage).
- Payer mix: Employer-sponsored plans lead, followed by Private Self-Pay, GreenCare HMO, etc.; heavy out-of-pocket reliance.
- Claim approval rate ~88-91%, but denials/pending ~7-8% represent optimization opportunities.
- Department gaps: Inpatient & Surgery/OR show largest payment shortfalls (e.g., 54-56% collection in some areas).

### 4. Performance, Quality & Patient Experience
- Average Length of Stay (LOS): 21 hours (fluctuates 20-23 hours seasonally).
- Readmission rate: ~10.55% (peaks in March/November ~12.6%).
- Satisfaction: Overall ~2.97/5; Outpatient highest-rated, Emergency lowest.
- Opportunities: Target readmission reduction in high months, improve LOS consistency, boost satisfaction in acute areas.


## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Prioritize hypertension screening & management programs.
- Optimize revenue cycle: Reduce denials in inpatient/surgery, improve follow-up on self-pay/employer claims.
- Target readmission interventions in peak months (March, November).
- Enhance patient experience in Emergency & Inpatient areas.
